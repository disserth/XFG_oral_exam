Description: 'Uses four types of copula (Gaussian, t, Clayton and Gumbel) to fit returns of 10 Internet and Software stocks in S&P500 (time period: 2015/05/01-2016/04/25), computes the Kendall''s tau, Spearman''s rho and tail dependence matrix of corresponding estimated copula. Simulates these four types of copula and creates contour plot, perspective plot and scatter plot for each copula. Estimates a portfolio VaR using simulated Gaussian Copula.'
